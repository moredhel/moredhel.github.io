title: Veganese in Warsaw
---
I am pretty surprised and impressed by the Vegan scene in Warsaw! I was there for a week and managed to eat in a different, totally Vegan restaurant every week. In and of itself, it's not that impressive for a capital city (I'm looking at you Amsterdam, you can do better!).

I particularly loved that Mango was so easy to find and utilise, and who can turn down so much Hummus & Falafel? I was in love!
