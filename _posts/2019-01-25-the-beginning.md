Hello there, welcome to my first post about me. I don't really talk about myself, so I intend to try here. It will be a mixture of things ranging from how I feel at a particular time to what I am thinking.

I don't do this to draw attention to myself, but more for me to have something to look back on. I also hope that whoever does come across this feels like they aren't alone. Sometimes the world can be a very lonely place, especially when you are surrounded by people.

With the introduction done, I am going to retire for the night as I am too tired to think straight.
